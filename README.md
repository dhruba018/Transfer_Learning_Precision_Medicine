#### Transfer_Learning_Precision_Medicine
Predictive modeling of drug sensitivity is an important step in precision therapy design and often there is a shortage of suitable data for modeling. Here we use the publicly available data from two large pharmacogenomic studies-- [CCLE](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle) and [GDSC](http://www.cancerrxgene.org/) for designing a predictive model _via_ transfer learning.  

Application of Transfer Learning in Cancer Drug Sensitivity Prediction. Includes two approaches based on **Latent Variable Cost Optimization** and **Domain Transfer via Nonlinear Mapping** techniques.
