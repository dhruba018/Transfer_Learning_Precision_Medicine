## Transfer Learning for Precision Medicine  
Predictive modeling of drug sensitivity is an important step in precision therapy design and often there is a shortage of suitable data for modeling. Hence we attempt to use data from multiple sources for modeling purposes and the recent advent of large-scale pharmacogenomic studies offers a convenient getaway from this conundrum. 

### Description
**Data.**  
We use *in vitro* transcriptomic and drug sensitivity information from the administration of various anticancer drugs on multiple Cancer cell lines of different subtypes. This data were obtained from two renowned large-scale pharmacogenomic studies - 
   * [Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/about/). A collaboration between Broad Institute and Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research.
   * [Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/about). A collaboration between Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK) and Center for Molecular Therapeutics at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center (USA). 

There is a considerable overlap between the two studies and we have explored the existing *inconsistencies between datasets* in our previous work in Briefings in Bioinformatics: [Evaluating the consistency of large-scale pharmacogenomic studies](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/20/5/1734/5034074). 

**Approaches.**  
We have combined datasets from CCLE and GDSC through **Transfer Learning** since the samples from two different sources cannot be used together directly. To eliminate the distribution shift present in the two sets, we have implemented two different TL approaches - 
   * <ins><b>Latent Variable based Cost Optimization</b></ins>.  
     We use the notion of a *Latent variable space* to model the underlying similarities between the genomic and sensitivity datasets and attempt to minimize the discepancies through cost optimization.

     where <i><b>z</b><sub>p</sub></i> and <i><b>z</b><sub>s</sub></i> represents the primary (target) and secondary (source) sets, and <i><b>w</b></i> is the underlying latent variable.  
     We have implemented three different optimization based approaches - 
      * Latent regression prediction
      * Latent-latent prediction
      * Combined latent prediction
   * <ins><b>Domain Transfer _via_ Nonlinear Mapping</b></ins>.  
     We implement a one-to-one mapping between the samples in the primary and secondary datasets using the *Polynomial regression mapping*.

     where <i><b>z</b><sub>p, k</sub></i> and <i><b>z</b><sub>s, k</sub></i> represents the <i><b>k</b></i>-th feature (gene/drug) in the primary and secondary sets, and <i><b>Î³</b></i> is the polynomial mapping coefficient.      

The details of these approaches are described in the 2018 paper [Application of transfer learning for cancer drug sensitivity prediction](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2465-y). Below provides an overview of the TL scenarios involved in this implementation.
